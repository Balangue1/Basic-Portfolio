                <img src="./assets/images/IMG_9154.JPG" alt="Jennifer Profile Pic" id="self"> My name is Jennifer Balangue. 
                I graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1998 with a Bachelor
                of Science degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Science. I have 20 years
                experience in the Information Technology industry. I have gained 13 years experience as an iSeries Programmer
                Analyst. My desire to learn more about the Networking/Infrastructure side of IT led me to my current role
                as a Technical Support Analyst. The experience in both areas has provided me with a unique skillset. The
                technical proficiencies gained from these roles include COBOL, DB2, SQL, UNIX, IBM iSeries, Windows 7 and
                Windows 10 implementation and support.
            </p>
            <p>
                A constant eagerness to expand my knowledge has driven me to pursue a certification through the Coding Bootcamp Program at
                Georgia Tech. Not only am I excited to be learning new languages, I am also thrilled to be able to express
                my creativity through web development as presented in my portfolio. I am experienced in HTML5, CSS, Javascript,
                JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node Js and MySQL.
